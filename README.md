# OneSignal Rust API Sample

OneSignal makes engaging customers simple and is the fastest, most reliable service to send push notifications, in-app messages, SMS, and emails.

This project demonstrates sending push notifications using the OneSignal Rust API client. You can use this project as a boilerplate or reference to start your project.


## üö¶ Getting started

This project assumes that you already have a OneSignal app created with push notifications setup. If you don't yet have a OneSignal app, [create one](#) first, then follow the steps to [integrate the OneSignal SDK](#) into your Android or iOS app.

### Steps

1. Make a copy of `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`
2. Replace the variable descriptions with its respective value from your OneSignal app on the dashboard.
3. Run the command `cargo run`
